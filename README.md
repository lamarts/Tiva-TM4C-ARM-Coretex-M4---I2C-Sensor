# Tiva-TM4C-ARM-Coretex-M4---I2C-Sensor 
This embedded c program provides the software to program a Tiva C MCU TM4C123G using I2C protocol with a MCP9808 digital 
temperature sensor.   The UART interface will be used to display the temperature data to a pc serial terminal.

The MCP9808 Temperature data sheet and the LM4F120H5QR data sheet are used for references.   The TI Peripheral Library Drivers are used
extensively, however, the data sheets must be used in order to understand the library files.
